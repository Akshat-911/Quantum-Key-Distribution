# ðŸ”‘ Quantum Key Distribution (BB84 Protocol) â€“ Qiskit Simulation

This project implements a simulation of the **BB84 quantum key distribution protocol** using **Qiskit**. It models how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely generate a shared secret key in the presence of a potential eavesdropper (Eve) by leveraging quantum principles.

---

## ðŸ“œ Description

The BB84 protocol is one of the earliest and most well-known quantum key distribution schemes. It utilizes the principles of quantum superposition and the no-cloning theorem to ensure secure communication. This simulation models:

- Random bit and basis generation by Alice and Bob.
- Qubit encoding based on Aliceâ€™s random bits and bases.
- Interception and measurement by Eve using random bases.
- Final measurement by Bob.
- Secret key generation and eavesdropping detection using parity check.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Simulated

- **Quantum Bits (Qubits)**: Represented and manipulated using `QuantumCircuit`.
- **Measurement in Different Bases**: Standard (Z) and Hadamard (X) bases.
- **Eavesdropping Detection**: By comparing parity of shared bits.
- **Aer Simulator**: Simulates the quantum circuits using Qiskit's `qasm_simulator`.

## ðŸ“‚ File Overview

- `bb84_simulation.py`: Main simulation script implementing BB84 protocol logic.
- (Note: This file assumes Qiskit is correctly installed, including `qiskit-aer`.)

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `qiskit`
- `qiskit-aer`
- `numpy`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer numpy
```

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Run the main script to execute the BB84 simulation:

```bash
python bb84_simulation.py
```

The output will display:

- The random keys generated by Alice and Bob.
- Eve's intercepted data (if any).
- Whether the key exchange is successful or eavesdropping is detected.

## ðŸ“Œ Example Output

```
Final Keys:
Alice's Key: [0, 1, 1, 0]
Bob's Key:   [0, 1, 1, 0]
Eve's Key:   [0, 1, 0, 1]

Key Exchange Successful: No interference detected.
```

or

```
Final Keys:
Alice's Key: [1, 0, 1, 1]
Bob's Key:   [1, 0, 0, 1]
Eve's Key:   [0, 1, 1, 0]

Warning: Possible eavesdropping detected!
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Troubleshooting

If you encounter:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.providers.aer'
```

Make sure to install `qiskit-aer` specifically using:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
```
